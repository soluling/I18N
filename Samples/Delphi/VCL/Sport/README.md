# Soluling's Delphi Sport Samples

This directory contains Soluling's Delphi Sport samples. Each sample gets the sport data from different locations, such as.

- Rest API (`ApiResource`)
- Local database (`DatabaseRecord` and `DatabaseGrid`)
- JSON file as a resource (`JsonResource`)
- XML file as a resource (`XmlResource`)
- INI file as a resource (`IniResource`)
- Text file as a resource (`TextResource`)
- Resource string table (`StringTable`)

`DatabaseGrid` shows the sport data in a grid view. All other shows in a form that show one sport.
